# Sudoku Hidato

Hidato Sudoku is a puzzle game where the goal is to fill a board with consecutive numbers that connect horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The smallest number is 1, and the largest number corresponds to the total number of squares on the board. Each numberâ€™s predecessor and successor must be in adjacent squares.

This project includes a solver and generator for Hidato puzzles, implemented in Haskell.

## Features

- **Generates** random Hidato puzzles.
- **Solves** Hidato puzzles.
- Written in **Haskell**.

## How to Run

1. Open the Haskell compiler (`ghci`) in the project directory.
2. Load the main file:
   ```haskell
   :load main
   ```
3. To generate a board with dimensions n and m, use:
```haskell
board <- generate n m
```
4. To solve the generated board, use:
```haskell
solve board
```
## Installation
